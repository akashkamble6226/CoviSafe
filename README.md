# CoviSafe

Description - As the problem statement provided I have created an app UI which will showcase the current cases of covid 19 in india and their details. And as we all know that currently our country is facing second wave of covid 19. As government have already clarified that third way would target the small childrens. So to encounter this problem I have created an app which will help parents to analyse the data of their childs by simply putting their daily heart rate and oxygen level. Parents will understand the exact time to go to doctor on basis of the covisafe app data. Adults know which pain they have and they can simply tell others but childrens don't express their pain until it becomes severe pain.
This is the reason I have built it.
